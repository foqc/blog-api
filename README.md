This project is an implementation of JWT auth in NodeJS using the json web token (jwt). This app is a Node API that serves data to a seperate React application, found [here](https://github.com/foqc/redux-learn).

## Why Did I Build This?

This app was built for the purpose of learning about REST API on NodeJS, and as backend of redux-learn project.
